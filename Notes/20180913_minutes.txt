Attendees: Laura, Jason, Randy, Luke, Frank, Andrew, Marty, Ron, Jay,
Ryan

- Q: Randy asks about long duration proposals

  * These seem to be a specific designation for ongoing projects, but
    Ryan will contact program officer

- Jay: Broader impacts shouldn't be an issue.  This is a facility
  instrument and the future upgrades can fit into BI
  * Randy likes the term "pilot program"

- Frank asks if the UWB Rx itself is part of the ATI
  * No, just the digitization/RFI excision

- Ron points out that for long-term vision, would need to think about
  how to split the sampled band up into manageable subbands

- Jay asks how we would get the digital signal from the telescope
  to the receiver room
  * Randy says over high speed LAN

- Jay: strongest arguments are higher dynamic range for RFI excision
  and eliminating unstable components for baseline stability

- Luke would like to see mention of heterogenous computing and deep
  learning and AI in mind

- Jay points out that there was a solicitation for spectrum management

- Jay points out that GBT was built to be RFI resistant
  * More effective time sharing by excising at shorter time intervals

- Ron mentions that you could use reference antenna for RFI excision
  * The tech could go on an omni-directional antenna for active RFI
    removal from existing receivers

- Jay thinks the sense of a prototype is important for strengthening
  the proposal

- Ron points out that this would be a big deal for Breakthrough Listen

- Regarding shielding, Randy emphasizes that the electronics group
  can tackle EMI compliance at the design phase
  * Shouldn't be thinking in terms of just shielding, should think in
    terms of designing a quiet system that doesn't need to be
    externally shielded as much
    - Randy will provide a paragraph about this for the proposal
  * We have already done this with CCB

- Luke points out that ngVLA will need to do this
  * There is a memo out on this

- Luke doesn't think Richard is preparing an ATI for RFI excision
  * Will keep us appraised

- Randy thinks CASPER is very good at looking at cutting edge of
  technology but was not thrilled with the deliverables on the VEGAS
  front

- Ron points out that we need to think about how we would feed it into
  the DCR for pointing, interface with GFM

- Jay points out that we could multicast the data stream to multiple
  backends, makes simultaneous science easier

- Luke points out that the increased bandwidth and bit depth will
  necessitate a change in packet format
  * Initial tests could be done by truncating packets and using 10gbE
  * Would need new NICs for the HPCs
