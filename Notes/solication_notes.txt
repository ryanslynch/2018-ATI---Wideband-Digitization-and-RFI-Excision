- Due Nov 15 @ 5 pm local time

- Keywords
  * Overarching science objectives (of AST)
  * Innovative/transformative technologies
  * Technology development/feasibility studies
  * New observations that are difficult or impossible
  * Public research products
  * Community coordination
  * Advance knowledge

> Encourages annual PI meeting
  * This sounds like a broader NSF/NASA event
  * Should include in budget

- Total budget is $8M for ~10 awards (so aim for < $800k)

- No cost sharing
  * Need to be careful to separate this from development of the UWB
? * Can we still mention Moore/GBO support to show commitment and
    outside support?

? Can we tie into spectrum management through the RFI excision
  component?

> Be sure to mention past summer student contributions to RFI
  exicision

- Can include hardware, software, and analysis

- Specifically mentions "methods for observing at wavelengths where
  there is heavy terrestrial electromagnetic interference"

- If we are using off-the-shelf products we need to demonstrate
  innovative use

- Encourages long duration efforts 
  * Mentions "one or more awards over time that support a single
    overarching science or technology objective"
    - This is a specific label - requires additional review criteria;
      may not be applicable here

- "Supports making enhanced capabilities available to the wider
  astronomical community"

> Only 3 co-authors allowed under "Collaborators & Other Affiliations
  Information" Table 4

> Include specific goals that can be evaluated for success
  * Include a bulleted list for each section?

> What do we want to do?  Why do we want to do it?  How do we plan to
  do it?  How will we know we succeed?  What are the benefits?

- Specific elements for merit review:
1. What is the potential for the proposed activity to 
   a. Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or
   across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and
   b. Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader
   Impacts)?
2. To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore
creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?
3. Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned,
well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan
incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
4. How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to
conduct the proposed activities?
5. Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the
home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed
activities?

- ATI-specific criteria: 
  * Motivation: Must have strong scientific motivation.  May include
    technology development plan
  * Innovation: Significantly advance state-of-the-art and new
    frontiers in science
  * Commitment to the public: Must make enhanced capabilities
    available to wider astronomical community
    - UWB will be general-user
    - RFI mitigation will be general user
    - Enhances failicity
    - "May be a decisive criteria among comparable proposals"
  * Long duration efforts: I don't think this applies here

> IM must be identified as a separate section in the proposal

> "Year" must be defined when discussion senior personnel and wages

- Need to sort out collaborators quickly so there is time to take care
  of paperwork

** Each collaborator must fill out a COA table (PAPPG 39)

- Project/performace site must correspond to physical location of GBO

? The PPAG lists "Historical Places" under "Other Information" on the
   cover sheet (pg 44).  It seems like information may be requested
   later on but we should seek clarification.

- BIs can be: 1) participation of women and minorities, 2) education
  and educator development, 3) scientific literacy and public
  engagement, 4) development of a STEM workforace, 5) partnerships
  between academia and industry, 6) economic competitiveness, 7)
  enhanced infrastructure for research and education.

? Is this an "Equipment Proposal"?

> All projects requiring a portion of time of the PI and any other SP
  must be included enven if they receive no salary support
  ? How does this apply to regular work activities?

? Does this count as an Equipment proposal as described on page II-41
  of the PAPPG or a Research Infrastructure Proposal as described on
  page II-44
