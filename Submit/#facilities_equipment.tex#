\section{Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources}

\subsection{Green Bank Observatory}
\label{sec:gbo}

The Green Bank Observatory (GBO) is a Federally-Funded Research and
Development Center whose mission is to enable forefront research into
the radio universe by providing world-leading telescopes,
instrumentation and expertise, training the next generation of
scientists and engineers, and promoting astronomy to foster a more
scientifically literate society.

GBO operates the Robert C.\ Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT), the
world's largest fully steerable telescope.  The GBT provides nearly
continuous frequency coverage from $0.3$--$116\; \GHz$ and a diverse
suite of instruments, including two CASPER-based digital spectrometers
with spectral line and pulsar observing modes.  GBO also operates a
number of additional research-class telescopes, including a 20-m
telescope equipped with a ROACH1-based digital back-end that has been
used to prototype real-time radio frequency interference (RFI)
techniques.

\subsubsection{Digital Electronics Group}
\label{sec:digital_group}

GBO digital engineers have over 40 years combined experience
designing, building, testing, deploying, and operating world-leading
instruments for radio astronomy.  This includes expertise in the
design of low-power and low-noise electronics and the Xilinx Vivado
tool flow for complex firmware design.  Our group has also become
active in designing and implementing real-time RFI excision algorithms
in firmware design, and have recently completed the first real-time
CASPER-based system for mitigating impulsive RFI such as airport
RADAR.

An undergraduate funded by this project will be co-mentored by the
digital electronics group and the PI.

\subsubsection{Radio Quiet Zones}
\label{sec:quiet_zone}

GBO is located in the heart of the 13,000 square-mile National Radio
Quiet Zone (NRQZ) and the West Virginia Radio Astronomy Zone (WVRAZ).
The NRQZ was established by the Federal Communications Commission and
the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee in 1958 to minimize
possible harmful interference to the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory in Green Bank, WV (now GBO) and the radio receiving
facilities for the United States Navy in Sugar Grove, WV.  The NRQZ
provides regulatory protection by requiring coordination between GBO
and all new or modified, permanent, fixed, licensed transmitters
inside the NRQZ, as specified for federal transmitters by NTIA manual
section 8.3.9 and for non-federal transmitters by the FCC in 47 CFR
section 1.924.  The NRQZ office at GBO ensures that the power flux
density of transmitters within the zone does not exceed certain
frequency-dependent thresholds, and works with with stakeholders to
mitigate any non-compliant devices.  Mitigation methods include the
use of directional antennas, locating transmitters to areas that
provide terrain shielding, or selecting a different frequency where
the transmitter power is within limits.

The WVRAZ provides stricter protection within a more limited
geographic area.  Within two miles of GBO all electrical devices that
interfere with the operation of GBO are prohibited.  This includes the
use of wireless internet, Bluetooth, and broadband transmitters such
as microwave ovens, to name but a few.  Between a two-mile and
ten-mile radius from GBO, strict power dissipation requirements are in
place.

The NRQZ and WVRAZ are a unique and invaluable resource for GBO, but
cannot protect against all forms of interference.  Notable exceptions
are the growing use of car RADAR collision avoidance systems,
aircraft, and communications satellites.  This necessitates observing
systems that produce high-quality data in the presence of RFI, such as
the one we will build as part of this project.

\subsubsection{Anechoic Test Chamber}

A shielded anechoic chamber measuring $15' \times 15' \times 37'$ is
located in the Jansky Laboratory at GBO.  The chamber serves as both a
far-field antenna test range and evaluation suite for new equipment to
ensure compliance with limits on self-generated RFI.  The GBO
Interference Protection Group evaluates all equipment and devises
mitigation techniques as needed.  The anechoic chamber will be used to
evaluate all hardware developed as part of this project, including all
equipment that will be installed near the GBT radio receivers.

\subsubsection{Machine Shop}

GBO operates a full machine shop that can build custom fabricated
parts as needed.  We do not anticipate heavy use of the machine shop
for this project, but could rely on it to build RFI-shielded casings
for the electronics that will be placed in the GBT receiver and
equipment rooms.

\subsubsection{Education and Public Outreach}

GBO has a nationally recognized, fully-developed education and public
outreach program.  The Green Bank Science Center hosts over 50,000
visitors each year.  Over 3,000 students annually take part in various
on-site educational programs.  GBO has a variety of long- and
short-term housing, including a dormitory that sleeps up to 60
students (which will be used for the two-week internship) and on-site
housing for summer research students (which will be used for the
undergraduate student supported by this proposal).  GBO is a member of
the NSF-INCLUDES Alliance First 2 Network.

\subsubsection{Project Management}

GBO has established budget management, project management, and systems
engineering processes developed in adherence with the NSF's
requirements as per its Large Facilities Manual (NSF 17-066, March
2017). The GBO team includes an experienced and credentialed program
management and systems engineering professional who will coordinate,
track, and report on activities from a project and programmatic
view. Scope, schedule, costs, and risks will be managed using GBO
standard operating procedures.

\subsection{The University of California, Berkeley}

GBO staff will work in collaboration with UCB's Collaboration for
Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics (CASPER). The primary goal
of CASPER is to streamline and simplify the design flow of radio
astronomy instrumentation by promoting design reuse through the
development of platform-independent, open-source hardware and
software.  CASPER's aim is to couple the real-time streaming
performance of application-specific hardware with the design
simplicity of general-purpose software. By providing parameterized,
platform-independent ``gateware'' libraries that run on
reconfigurable, modular hardware building blocks, we abstract away
low-level implementation details and allow astronomers to rapidly
design and deploy new instruments.

Dan Werthimer is the director of the UCB SETI program and
CASPER. Werthimer is also associate director of the Berkeley Wireless
Research Center. Werthimer will provide local mentoring to a UCB
undergraduate student.

Jack Hickish is a staff researcher in UCB's Radio Astronomy
Lab. Hickish will develop CASPER blocks for interfacing with
peripherals through 100-GbE and PCIe.

Both Werthimer and Hickish will act as unfunded collaborators and
technical advisers to the GBO digital engineering team.
